## Overview

Established in 2022, TUKUPI is a music project led by the brazilian DJ and aspiring music producer Lucas Borges. Born and raised in São Paulo (BRA), Lucas is currently situated in Urbana-Illinois (USA), where he is pursuing his PhD. Inspired by the Brazilian Tropicália movement and the soulful 80s disco, TUKUPI seamlessly traverses between organic and hypnotic elements, and combines deep and melodic grooves into a dynamic and immersive musical experience which transcends genres.
