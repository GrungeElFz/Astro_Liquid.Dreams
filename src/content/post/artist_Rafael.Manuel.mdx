## Overview

Rafael Manuel from Miami, Florida. Although beginning his journey with more Latin influences, Rafael’s sets have evolved since spending time with resident Chicago djs and partying with some of Europe’s best( Prunk, Kolter, Chris Stussy, Rossi, Josh baker, M-High, Tomas station and more).

His sets bring a mix of classic house tracks and the new sound coming out of Amsterdam and the UK. With an obsession of finding new music, Rafael’s sets are never the same, introducing the crowd to a new experience every time.

> Good DJs play tracks the crowd likes, great DJs play tracks the crowd didn’t even know they liked.
