## Overview

Santa Cecilia is the creative project of life partners Renan and Jacob, named for the Sao Paulo neighborhood where the two vinyl-only DJs first met a decade ago. Their sets are a journey through soundscapes that blend creamy synths, trippy breaks, and spacey pads, at all times driven by a pulse that is undeniably queer. 

Aggressively working the decks to transition from house to jungle, garage, breaks, trance & DnB, santa cecilia find inspiration in contemporary and classic labels like Peach Discs, Klasse Wrecks, Craigie Knowes, T4T LUV NRG, Guerrilla, Network, and E-SA.

As longtime ravers who recently stepped behind the decks, Jacob and Renan invoke the liberatory power of the dancefloor to inspire love, community, and healing in trans and queer communities.
