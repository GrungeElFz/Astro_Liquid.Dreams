## Overview

Originating from Bangkok, Thailand. Gee's journey through electronic music commenced in 2012, navigating through diverse sub-genres before finding a home in Techno. His niche spans a spectrum of Techno styles, including Acid, Industrial, Dub, Hypnotic, and beyond.

Gee has a diverse background, having been a former professional cyclist, a freelance photographer, a color grader, a music producer, a digital painter, and a software engineer.

Despite being associated with DJing, Gee dismisses conventional labels, expressing a profound desire to simply immerse himself in curated sounds on expansive sound systems as his typical statement ;

> I’m not a DJ, I’m just simply being here to listen to my selected tracks on a big sound system.
